# To DO list

## 1. Core Design & Architecture

* [x] **Mirror Riot’s API structure** intuitively (e.g., `api.summoner.by_name(region, name)` instead of arbitrary endpoints).
* [x] **Encapsulate endpoints as modules or classes** (account, summoner, match, league, etc).
* [x] **Provide clear data models** (e.g., Pydantic models for responses — `SummonerDTO`, `MatchDTO`).
* [x] **Handle authentication** cleanly (API key via env var, config file, or parameter).

---

## 2. HTTP Layer & Error Handling

* [ ] Automatic **retry and rate-limit handling** (429 responses, backoff, respecting headers).
* [x] Friendly **exceptions** (e.g., `RiotAPIError`, `RateLimitError`, `NotFoundError`).
* [ ] Timeout handling, connection pool reuse.
* [x] Optionally log all requests and responses (for debugging).

---

## 3. Data Models (DTOs)

```python
class SummonerDTO(BaseModel):
    profile_icon_id: int
    revision_date: int
    puuid: str
    summoner_level: int
    id: Optional[str]
```

* [x] Type-safe responses.
* [x] Autocompletion in IDEs.
* [x] Built-in validation and parsing.

---

## 4. Developer Experience (DX)

* [x] Intelligent autocomplete (clear method names, type hints).
* [x] Helpful docstrings.
* [x] Friendly errors (e.g., “Invalid region: must be one of EUW1, NA1, KR…”).
* [x] Toggleable logging.

---

## 5. Packaging & Distribution

* [x] Well-structured package (`src/pyke_lol/...`).
* [x] Proper `pyproject.toml` (with metadata, classifiers, dependencies).
* [x] `README.md` with usage examples and badges.
* [x] `LICENSE`, and versioning (`0.1.0` → `0.2.0`).
* [x] Built docs (using `pdoc` or `mkdocs-material`).
* [x] CI pipeline (GitHub Actions) that runs PyPI build on release.

---

## 6. Testing

* [x] Unit tests (for each endpoint wrapper).
* [x] CI pipeline (GitHub Actions) that runs tests + lints on commit.
* [x] Coverage report (badge in README).
* [ ] Test endpoints with multiple regions/continents and multiple users.

---

## 7. Utilities & Enhancements

* [x] Support for both “platform” and “regional” routing values (e.g., EUW1 vs EUROPE).

---

## 8. Documentation

* [ ] High-level overview: what it is, how to install, quickstart.
* [ ] Endpoint examples for all major APIs.
* [x] API reference (autogenerated with `pdoc` or `mkdocs`).

---

## 9. Branding & Presentation

* [x] Nice README with badges (PyPI version, build, docs, license).
* [x] Logo or banner.
* [x] Clear tagline.
* [ ] Example image (like “fetch summoner rank in 3 lines”).

---

## 10. Optional Advanced Features

* [ ] Auto-discovery of endpoints (fetch from Riot’s OpenAPI spec).
